# Week 4 Overview Video

+ Housekeeping announcements. Nothing that I don't know already.
+ Professionalism

    + Must present results from queries in a professional manner
    + Always best practice to throw on an ORDER BY 
        + Best practice to ORDER BY column name rather than column number/position
    + Always best practice to include extra columns that provide more context 
    
+ Queries

    + Always best to breakdown complex queries into smaller chunks (sub-queries)
    + be intentional with parantheses ()


# 04-01: Chp 10 UNION

## UNION

+ UNION <- Combines ROWs from 2 or more data sets

    + Comparable data sets
        + Same number of columns (usually)
        + Same data types in columns (usually)
        + SQL Server supports "dissimilar" data sets
    + NOT
        + Not a JOIN
        + Not an INTERSECT
        + Not an INCLUDE / EXCLUDE
    + UNION is a combination to make 1 new data set
    
+ Archive storage <- data warehouse
+ Compared to JOIN

    + expectation is that each column has the same type of data 
    + UNION is stacking the two tables on top of each other
    + JOIN is combining the two tables to make a new dataset

![](JOIN_vs_UNION.png)

## UNION BUILDING

+ Data sets created with usual SELECT statement

    + Simple
    + Complex

+ Column names?

    + uses the column header names in the First SELECT statement
    + Must spend time to make sure they are properly labeled
    
+ UNION

    + UNION performs DISTINCT by default
        + based upon actual values
    + UNION ALL keeps duplicates
    + If you know there are no DUPS between 2 tables, use UNION ALL <- better performance
        + either you know there are no duplicates
        + or you want the duplicates
        
+ Example

    + SELECT ProductID, Name, ProductNumber
      FROM Production.Product
      WHERE ProductNumber LIKE 'BK-M%'
      UNION
      SELECT ProductID, Name, ProductNumber
      FROM Production.Product
      WHERE ProductNumber LIKE 'BK-R%';
      
+ Practice using Sales Order and Bowling DB's

## UNION COMPLEX

+ I want to analyze all the purchase orders with their detail lines, which includes all the lines from both the original purchase order and any purchase order changes

    + Common to track change orders to the original purchase order
    + leads to tracking % growth

![](PO_Lines.png)

+ A single PO could have multiple changes
+ A PO Change introduces multiple PO Lines ('POChgID')

+ PO Analysis

    + # get the original PO lines
    SELECT po1.PONumber, 'Original' AS POType,
      po1.PODescription, po1.OrderDate AS PODate, 
      pol.LineNumber, pol.LineDescription, polQuantity
    FROM POHeaders AS po1 INNER JOIN POLines AS pol ON po1.POID = pol.POID  # this gives everything from PO whether it's a change order or OG
    WHERE pol.POChgID IS NULL  # this gives me only the original lines
    
    UNION ALL 
    
    + # get all the change lines
    SELECT po2.PONumber, 'Chg NO: ' + poc.POChgNumber AS POType, 
      poc.ChgDescription, poc.ChgDate,
      pol.LineNumber, pol.LineDescription, pol.Quantity
    FROM POHeaders AS po2
    INNER JOIN POChanges AS poc ON po2.POID = poc.POID
    INNER JOIN POLines AS pol2 ON poc.POChgID = pol2.POChgID
    
    ORDER BY PONumber, POType, LineNumber; (ORDER BY 1, 2, 5)
    
+ Possible

    + Complex SELECTs are fine
        + JOINs of all types
        + Filtering with WHERE
        + Should be able to run independently
    + UNION ALL
        + More efficient than UNION
    ORDER BY must be at the end
        + Use column names 

# 04-02: Chp 11 SubQuery Part 1

+ Creating solutions rather than just pulling data

## SubQuery Overview

+ Subqueries aka "nested query"

    + process of including a SELECT statement
    + Inside
        + SELECT (INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE)
        + FROM
        + WHERE
    + SQL is declarative, so the DBMS will figure it out. Don't need to worry about the order of things
    
+ Table subquery

    + Returns multiple columns and rows
    + Often used in WHERE clauses
    + Also in SELECT clauses for aggregates

+ Scalar subquery

    + Returns only 1 column and 1 row (aka a value)

+ Row subquery (not typically supported)

+ Why do subqueries?

    + answer complex questions with simpler statements
    + filter data with data from tables not used elsewhere
    + improve query performance
    + cleaner SQL statements and cleaner solutions
    + help with debugging
    
+ SELECT

    + SELECT OrderNumber, OrderDate,
      (
      SELECT c.CustLastName
      FROM Customers AS c
      WHERE c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
      ) AS LastName
    FROM Order AS o;
    
+ FROM

    + SELECT a.lname, a.fname, t.tile
      FROM 
      (
      SELECT lname, fname, authorid
      FROM authors
      WHERE state = 'CA'
      ) AS a  # this SELECT on California authors is a "virtual table"
    INNER JOIN titles AS t
    ON a.authorid = t.authorid;
      
+ WHERE

    + SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, c.city
      FROM Customers AS c
      WHERE customer_ID IN
        (
        SELECT customer_id
        FROM orders AS o
        WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2019
        );

## SELECT - Subquery Overview

+ Use Cases

    + Allows the creation of unique Expressions in the SELECT clause
        + Always a SCALAR subquery (1 row, 1 column; 1 single value. Not a whole set of columns)
        + Avoid overly complex INNER and OUTER JOINs
        + Focus on single column instead
        + easier to debug
        
+ Column - INNER JOIN

    + SELECT o.OrderNumber, 
        c.CustLastName AS LastName,
        o.OrderDate, o.ShipDate
      FROM Order AS o
      INNER JOIN Customers AS c
      ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
      WHERE o.ShipDate = '2020-04-10';
    + List order and customers from yesterday
    + SELECT o.OrderNumber,
      (
      SELECT c.CustLastName
      FROM Customers AS c
      WHERE c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
      ) AS LastName,  # this query happens for each row that's selected in o.OrderNumber
      o.OrderDate, o.ShipDate
    FROM Order AS o
    WHERE o.ShipDate = '2020-04-10'; 

## SELECT Subquery Examples

+ COLUMNS: "list order and customers (AND status) from yesterday"

+ SELECT o.OrderNumber, o.OrderDate, o.ShipDate
      (
      SELECT 
        c.CustLastName + '-Active: '+ 
        IIF(c.Active,'Yes', 'No') AS CustNameStatus
      FROM Customers AS c
      WHERE c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
      ) AS CustNameStatus,  # this query happens for each row that's selected in o.OrderNumber
    FROM Order AS o
    WHERE o.ShipDate = '2020-04-10'; 
    
+ Expression

    + List all orders and the maximum price from all line items in the order.
    + Of all the lines within the order, what's the max price?
    SELECT order_id, order_date,
      (
      SELECT MAX(list_price)  # must return single value
      FROM Sales.order_items AS i
      WHERE i.order_id = o.order_id
      ) AS max_list_price
    
    FROM sales.Orders AS o
    ORDER BY order_date desc;
    
    + List employees, salaries, average overall salary, and the difference
    SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, e.salary,
      (
      SELECT ROUND(AVG(salary), 0)
      FROM employees
      ) AS average_salary,
      
      e.salary - (SELECT ROUND(AVG(salary), 0)  # must repeat calculation in this subquery - can't call 'average_salary'
        FROM employees) AS difference
        
      FROM employees AS e
      ORDER BY first_name, last_name
      
    + compare departments in previous question
    SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, e.salary,
      (
      SELECT ROUND(AVG(salary), 0)
      FROM employees AS e1
      WHERE e1.DepartmentID = e.DeaprtmentID
      ) AS average_dept_salary,
      
      e.salary - (SELECT ROUND(AVG(salary), 0)  # must repeat calculation in this subquery - can't call 'average_salary'
        FROM employees AS e2
        WHERE e2.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID
        ) AS difference
        
      FROM employees AS e
      ORDER BY first_name, last_name

## SELECT - SubQuery Hands On

+ Practice SELECT subqueries on virtual desktop

## FROM Subquery Overview

+ Subquery in the FROM clause is creating a dataset that combines information from multiple tables, creating a "virtual table"
+ Uses

    + allows the creation and use of a "virtual" table in the FROM clause
    + way to gather data from multiple sources without using INNER and OUTER JOINs
    + easier to debug
    
+ Example

    + List mountain bike current and historical quantity sold by Product number and Model
    
    SELECT p.ProductNumber, m.ModelName, p.QtySold, p.When
    FROM
        (
        SELECT ProductNumber, ModelID, SUM(QtySold) AS QtySold, 'Current' AS [When]
        FROM ProductSales
        WHERE ProductNumber LIKE 'BK-M%'
        GROUP BY 1, 2
        
        UNION ALL
        
        SELECT ProductNumber, ModelID, SUM(QtySold) AS QtySold, 'Archive' AS [When]
        FROM ProductSalesArchive
        WHERE ProductNumber LIKE 'BK-M%'
        GROUP BY 1, 2
        ) AS p
    INNER JOIN Production.Model AS m
    ON p.ModelID = m.ModelID;

# 04-02: Chp 11 SubQuery Part 2

+ Example: List crimes and totals for those days

    SELECT c.*, subq.incidents  # c.* <- all information on crimes from c table
    FROM Crimes AS c
    INNER JOIN
        (
        SELECT date, COUNT(incident_num) AS [incidents]
        FROM Crimes
        GROUP BY date
        ) AS subq
    ON c.date = subq.date  # inner join on date
    ORDER BY subq.incidents DESC, c.time
    
    + use a table twice to get information from it

## FROM Subquery Examples

+ Example: Show the number of activities for each person by group they participate in 

    SELECT p.first_name, p.last_name,
           a.id_group, a.numActivities
    FROM Person AS p
    INNER JOIN
        (
        SELECT id_person, id_group, COUNT(*) AS numActivities
        FROM Activity
        GROUP BY id_person, id_group
        ) AS a
    ON (a.id_person = p.id_person)
    
    + makes more sense to add the subquery in the FROM clause to bring more than 1 column into the SELECT
    + if making the subquery in the SELECT clause, it must be scalar, so only 1 column can be selected at a time
    + having the subquery in the FROM clause enables you to generate more columns to bring into the SELECT

## FROM Subquery Hands On

+ Practice in SQL Server

## WHERE Subquery Overview

+ Uses

    + allows the creation and use of a "virtual" table in the WHERE clause
    + smooth way to perform filtering without cluttering up the FROM clause
    + easier to debug
    + can improve performance
    
+ WHERE

    + List customers from WA, OR, and CA
    
    SELECT CustomerName, OrderNumber, OrderDate,
    FROM Orders AS o
    INNER JOIN Customers AS c
    ON c.Customer_ID = o.Customer_ID
    WHERE c.State IN ('WA', 'OR', 'CA');
    
    + Subquery:
    
    SELECT CustomerName, OrderNumber, OrderDate,
    FROM Orders AS o
    WHERE Customer_ID IN
        (
        SELECT Customer_ID
        FROM Customers
        WHERE State IN ('WA', 'OR', 'CA')
        );
    

## WHERE Subquery Examples

+ List last month's Orders for NY customers

    SELECT Order_ID, Order_Date, Customer_ID
    FROM Sales.Order AS s
    INNER JOIN Sales.Customer AS c
    ON s.Customer_ID = c.Customer_ID
    WHERE c.City = 'New York'
    AND c.Order_Date BETWEEN ('2020-04-01' AND '2020-04-30');
    
    + Subquery on WHERE:
    
    SELECT Order_ID, Order_Date, Customer_ID
    FROM Sales.Order
    WHERE Customer_ID IN
        (
        SELECT Customer_ID
        FROM Sales.Customers
        WHERE Customer_City = 'New York'
        )
    AND c.Order_Date BETWEEN ('2020-04-01' AND '2020-04-30');
    
+ Show students with a current score of 90% or higher

    SELECT s.studentid, s.name, m.points
    FROM Student AS s
        INNER JOIN 
        (SELECT studentid, SUM(scores) as points
        FROM Grades GROUP BY 1) AS g
        ON s.studentid = g.studentid
    WHERE g.points > 
        (
        SELECT (SUM(a.pointspossible) * 0.9) AS Current90  # this creates single value
        FROM Assignments AS a
        WHERE a.duedate <= Date()
        ) AS Current90;
        
    + makes sense to do subquery in WHERE clause because no reason to bring Assignments table into FROM clause
        + do analysis on Assignments table first to generate a target to filter on 
        
+ WHERE EXISTS
+ WHERE IN
